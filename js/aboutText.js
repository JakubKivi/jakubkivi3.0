var aboutText = ["My name is Jakub Kuziemski, but people call me Kivi. I am currently working as a junior web developer in Skill & Chill, where I am using low-code Outsystems platform along with regular HTML, CSS, JS or SQL. Apart from that I am studying Robotics at Warsaw University of Technology (currently 2nd year). I also have experience from my previous job, students associations and mainly my own hobbistic projects.",
"My passion for programming started 7 years ago, back in the middle school. It wasn't unusual. I started my programming journey with some C++ christmas trees. Soon I realized that electronics is also a very interesting field, so I started experimenting with Arduino. I totally fell in love with the feeling of programming something more than just characters within console. For a few years I was almost sure that it is exactly what I want to do in future.",
"I decided to go for Robotics studies, because I could learn programming by myself. That is probably one of the worst decisions in my life. Robotics studies turned out to be mainly mechanic and math. I actually didn't see microcontroller until 4th semester. Besides it takes me so much time, that I almost abandoned my hobbystic programming.",
"For a moment I was a member of Studentsâ€™ Robotics Association and Students' Space Association, but I quickly realized that managing half-time job and full-time studies is more than enough if I want to have some free time for projects like this website. Also remote (because of pandemic) studies turned out to be difficult to manage within student's associations.",
"In my spare time, apart from programming I love traveling. To be honest my main goal is to work remotely and travel, which is really likely to happen but I have to finish studies first. I also really like playing video games, especially strategies, but casual Counter Strike with friends is also always fun. Moving on to sports I actually like most sports but mainly volleyball, football, rollerskating and skiing.",
"I know that's a lot about myself, but I wanted to put everything that might be interesting for someone interested in... Me. Because it is my own website. Technically github's but... Anyway. I am trying to make this less cringe, but I don't think I am doing well. If you would like to read more of my stories, there is a hidden button on footer, for those who managed to read this far. If you have any questions or you want to do something with me go to contact section."];
